# Recurring Rule Interface Extension for Directus

This adds an [RFC 5545](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545) style **Recurring Rule** interface extension to [Directus](https://directus.io/) using the [rrule](https://jakubroztocil.github.io/rrule) package.

The code is currently in a minimally viable state and needs improvements to be useful. PRs are welcome.
